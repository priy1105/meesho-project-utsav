# Project Utsav: A Strategic Proposal for Meesho built on React.js
üöÄ Overview
Project Utsav is an interactive proposal for a gamified, hyperlocal group-buying framework designed to significantly boost Meesho's Average Order Value (AOV) and build a strong sense of community trust before the company's IPO. The project was created by Priyanshu.

The Challenge: The Value Seeker's Paradox
Meesho has achieved massive scale in order volume, securing a 37% market share. However, this is offset by a low Average Order Value (AOV) of approximately ‚Çπ350. This results in a much smaller 8.5% market share by Gross Merchandise Value (GMV). The core challenge is to convert market-leading volume into market-leading value.

The Solution: Project Utsav
Project Utsav is a multi-layered framework that transforms shopping from a solitary transaction into a collective, gamified, and trusted community event.

Key Pillars:
The 'Utsav' Concept: This introduces time-bound, theme-based, hyperlocal shopping festivals, such as a "Pune Ganesh Chaturthi Decor Utsav." This approach aims to increase AOV by offering curated "Utsav Baskets" of related items.

Gamification Layer: A city-wide progress bar will track sales and unlock progressively higher discounts for all participants as community milestones are reached. This is designed to create a viral loop and encourage users to invite others.

Trust Layer: Top resellers are elevated to "Community Captains," who act as trusted curators for their locality. They vouch for product quality and use their social capital to drive sales, receiving a curation fee from Meesho to maintain the 0% commission model.

Projected Impact
The project includes an interactive financial simulator to demonstrate the potential financial uplift. The model projects a 243% AOV uplift, from a baseline of ‚Çπ350 to a projected Utsav AOV of ‚Çπ1,200, along with a 33% reduction in logistics costs.

Cross-Functional Execution Blueprint
The project is designed to be driven by the Business Management team, with collaboration across several key verticals:

Category Management: Owns the Utsav P&L and plans hyperlocal assortments.

User Growth: Designs viral loops and hyper-targeted campaigns.

Fulfillment & Experience: Leverages Valmo for bulk delivery and improves experience metrics.

Business Development: Develops the 'Community Captain' program.

Monetization: Improves core metrics and creates new ad revenue streams.

Risk Assessment & Mitigation
The project proactively addresses potential risks with the following mitigation strategies:

Operational Risk (Logistical Complexity): Phased pilot in 3-5 cities to refine processes.

Market Risk (Sales Cannibalization): Analyze purchasing data to ensure net-new spending.

Execution Risk (Captain Ineffectiveness): Implement a tiered system for Captains with performance-based rewards.

Financial Risk (Margin Erosion): The financial model is designed so that the AOV increase and logistics cost reductions offset discounts.
